# Polish Calculator
This is WIP calculator using Polish notation. This means that operations are listed before the numbers being operated on, 
similiar to how functions are written. One of the advantages of this system is that parenthesis are unneccesary. One of 
the disadvantages is that it's Polish.

# But Why?
Reverse polish (postfix) calculators are sometimes discussed in CS classes due to their ease to implement if stacks are 
used. I wanted to make something similiar as practice, but more like how people actually talk (+ 2 3 = sum of 2 and 3) 
and different so that I'd have to code something I haven't seen before.
